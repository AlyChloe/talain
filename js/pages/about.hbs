<p class="c-about">Talain is a director, singer & songwriter whose earnest, hyper-sensitive voice translates across mediums. Born in Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania, this independent artist’s efforts has earned him the opportunity to support acts like Pharrell, work with the likes of  Jon Castelli, and enjoy 30k in organic units sold of his first independent release without PR or label resources. With an acute talent for moving portraiture, Talain’s film work speaks the condition of individual worlds. The multi-disciplinary artist, in film and music, asks foremost that his subjects be their most vulnerable.</p>
